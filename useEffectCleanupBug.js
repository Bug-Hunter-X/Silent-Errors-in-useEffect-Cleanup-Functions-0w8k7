This error occurs when using the `useEffect` hook in React Native with a cleanup function that throws an error.  The error is often swallowed and not displayed in the console, making it difficult to debug.  For instance:

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const subscription = someObservable.subscribe(data => {
    // ... handle data ...
  });

  return () => {
    subscription.unsubscribe(); // This might throw if subscription is already unsubscribed
    throw new Error('Cleanup failed!'); // This error is often silent
  };
}, []);
```
